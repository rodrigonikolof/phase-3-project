<h3>What is it?</h3>
This application allows users to be created. Each one is initialised with a standard set of boards which can be used for creating notes, which can be categorised as required. 
The board uses a masonry layout to allow notes to stack up according to their size. 
The application was built as part of my software engineering course at Academy Xi (Flatiron School).
